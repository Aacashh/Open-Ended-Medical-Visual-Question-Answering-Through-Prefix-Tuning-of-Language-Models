# Open-Ended-VQA

This repository contains an implementation of the paper [Open-Ended Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05977.pdf) using smaller models. The project is also implemented as a Kaggle Notebook which you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aaaacash/open-ended-vqa/notebook).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Other dependencies (can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Getting Started
